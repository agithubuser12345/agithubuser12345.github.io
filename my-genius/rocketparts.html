        <h1>Rocket Parts Explained</h1>
        <p style="font-size:large">Rockets have a very complex build made by engineers from all over the world. There
            are four main systems
            (parts) of a rocket. This includes the structural, payload, guidance, and propulsion system. All rockets
            have stages for different reasons. This allows control crew to jettison parts they are no longer using
            making it easier to manuever or having different parts of the rocket for different objectives, i.e, primary
            fuel system to get the rocket into space, secondary fuel system for orbital/course correction manuevers, and
            the payload of the rocket.

        First off,
        you need to get the rocket into space, this uses the
        propulsion
        system which consists of fuel tanks, rocket boosters, engines, and more. This is why rockets must be so big
        as they contain nearly 700,000 pounds of fuel.
        Usually after the second stage rockets reduce to more than half their size. Rockets need a huge amount of
        fuel to escape Earth's gravity. Rockets also have a guidance system which is the computer that handles
        communication and radars, has advanced sensors, and is the control center of a rocket. Guidance systems also
        help rockets
        maintain stability and manuever during lift-off and while undergoing course corrections. Some rockets even have
        fins to assist the aerodynamics during the launch process. Guidance systems are very important
        in directing or intercepting targets or orbits. <br><br>


        As shown in the image, the structural frame is the body of the rocket. This can include fairings, rocket
        boosters and fuel tanks, and other aereodynamic parts. All rockets have some sort of mission whether it be
        launching a
        satellite to collect data or sending supplies to the ISS. This is called the payload system which usually
        located at the top of a rocket. This is usually the final stage of the objective/mission, however, probes like
        Voyager 1 have lasted for 40+ years!. These are the main systems of a rocket, however, the are much more complex
        than this! </p> <br><br>
