        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px" id="colorofheading">Rockets</p>
        <p style="font-size:large">Hello! I am Anish! One thing I really care about and have a great passion for is
            rocketry. A whole infinite
            universe lies ahead of us. Humankind is on a mission to explore this, and learning about rockets, rocket
            propulsion, and the mysteries of the universe makes this my something I am really passionate about.
            Rocketry
            is the field of science that deals with rocket propulsion and the exploration of space using
            rockets/man-made machines. A rocket is a propellant that carries payload. The simplest rockets date back
            to
            the 1200s in China when they were used for fireworks, armies, and celebrations. As we progressed, the
            idea
            of rockets has changed. On March, 26th, 1926, Robert Goddard, an American physicist, launched the first
            liquid-fueled rocket. He is known as the father of rocket propulsion.</p>

        <p style="font-size:large">Some of the things you will learn by reading this website are the basic parts of
            rockets, how rockets get
            into orbit and beyond, and other useful information.</p>
