            <h1>The Mission</h1>
            <p style="text-align:left">Artemis 1 is a rocket developed and made by NASA from parts and teams from all
                over the world. Artemis 1's main objective is to test the Space Launch System (SLS). NASA plans to send
                humans back to the moon by 2025 with updated and more advanced systems and rockets. Previously, Saturn V
                had carried out all Apollo missions. <br> Sadly, Artemis 1 has been delayed from its original launch
                date, August 29th, 2022, to currently, mid November. This was originally due to problems with the
                engines. After the scrub of the launch, a new date was proposed, September 3rd, 2022. However, a fuel
                leakage occured and due to many problems, NASA rolled back the rocket again. Just recently, hurricane
                Ian struck the coast of Florida which further delayed Artemis 1's launch. Luckily, nothing was damaged.
                Now, NASA projects a new launch date sometime during mid November, however, this could be further pushed
                as have many previous rockets (everything must be absolutely perfect for the rocket to launch so it is
                expected/common, for scrubs of the launch to happen) </p>
