<!-- How I challenged myself with this project: 
    I have challenged myself throughout this project by  finding good designs for the website that would be appealing to the customer and align with my mission plan for the client. 
    I also managed to find a way around the challenging problem of implementing a dark mode. 
    This was a feature I really wanted to add and I followed through and found a way to include this. 
    Overall, this project was fun as I had a lot of freedom in terms of redesigning a website, meaning I could make my visions and plans for the website real.

            <h1>About The Founder: Mark Wagner</h1>
            <p>Mark Wagner has been a power for progress in the automotive industry since 1976. For the first 15 years
                of his career, he worked at an auto repair shop and studied in Mainz, Germany. In 1986, he earned his
                Master’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering and used his qualifications to open his own business in
                Germany. Just a few years later, Mark moved his family and business to Bellevue, Washington in the
                United States. Since opening his first American auto repair facility for Japanese and European cars,
                Mark has expanded his operations to serve all kinds of vehicles! With each new endeavor on the Greater
                Eastside of Seattle, Mark has transformed the standards of the automotive industry. Today, his team of
                highly-trained and experienced technicians provides unparalleled auto services in Washington!
            </p>
            <h1>Major Milestones for Mark’s Japanese European Auto</h1>
            <p>In 1991, when Mark Wagner opened the first Bellevue Transmission in Bellevue, Washington, there was no
                expectation that the business would grow as rapidly as it did. After doubling their business in the
                first three years, Mark’s Japanese European Auto opened a second location in Kirkland, Washington in
                1995. In 1997, another location was added to the network in Redmond, Washington. By 2000, Mark’s
                Japanese European Auto became a leading resource for specialized transmission repairs in the area! The
                fourth location on the Greater Eastside opened in Issaquah, Washington in 2008.</p>
