            <h3>This Demo Will Show You How To Make A Loading Screen Animation</h3>
            <p>A loading screen animation is an animation that happens upon loading into the webpage. It can make
                websites
                look
                a lot better and they are good to use.</p>
            <p>Below is an example of how the animation will look.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="content1">
            <p>This animation will be done with CSS.</p>
            <p>Steps are listed and explained below:</p>
            <p>First, you need to create your index file, along with your css file.</p>
            <p>After, put in your basic HTML. This text will be what shows on your loading animation.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of the HTML code you will use: <br></p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:40%;" src="images/html_code.jpg" alt="html code image">
        <div class="content2">
            <p>After, you will need to add some attributes to your CSS classes. Head over to your CSS file and make the
                following classes for the body, container, and background.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:60%" src="images/css_starting_class.jpg" alt="starting CSS classes code">
        <br>
        <div class="content3">
            <p id="section2">If prefered, you can replace the image with another one. You can also adjust the color
                attributes within
                the
                classes in your CSS file to match your prefered loading screen animation ideas.</p>
            <p>Now we can start animating with CSS. We can use keyframes to make the animations and control what happens
                at
                different 'frames' or at different times of our animation.</p>
            <p>For example, the HTML text will load in, then the split screen animation will take place, following with
                different keyframe animations within the CSS to control the movements of the split screen.</p>
            <p>Below is an example of the split screen class along with the keyframe animation.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:60%;" src="images/split_screen_css.jpg" alt="split screen CSS code">
        <div class="content4">
            <p>Keyframes:</p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:60%;" src="images/keyframes1.jpg" alt="split-screen keyframe class CSS code">
        <div class="content5">
            <p>On your webpage, you should now have a screen with your split-screen cover becoming smaller due to the
                shift
                in
                width size from your keyframe class. <br> We can also add an animation to the split-screen using the
                following attributes.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:40%;" src="images/animation_delay.jpg" alt="animation delay code CSS">
        <img style="width:37%" src="images/animation_fill_mode.jpg" alt="animation fill mode CSS">
        <div class="content6">
            <p>Now we can add the animation to move the split screen to the right. We can call this animation in our CSS
                class called split-screen. This is an example of how the code
                would look like.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:45%;" src="images/moveright.jpg" alt="move right keyframe code CSS">
        <div class="content7">
            <p id="section3">We will also want to animate the HTML text. So far we have been using keyframes for the
                split-screen
                animation. For example, we could have the HTML code fade upwards, then have the background change. Below
                is an example of how it would look like.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:60%" src="images/other_keyframe_classes.jpg"
            alt="additional CSS keyframe code for animating HTML text">
        <div class="content8">
            <p>Once the split screen animation happens, we will want to change the HTML content too. Add this class to
                get the effect. Feel free to change it.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:40%" src="images/content_class.jpg" alt="content class code CSS">
        <div class="content9">
            <p>Lastly, we can add an animation to the comma to make the final result look better. This animation will
                fade the comma out with a keyframe animation applied to the content and comma class.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="width:60%" src="images/comma_css.jpg" alt="comma fade-away animation class code CSS">
        <div class="content10">
            <p>This is the end of the demo, if anything isn't working, go back to the previous steps to check for any
                mistakes or bugs.</p>
