Make a scrolling website with parallax and animations

Make it sort of space themed with black background? In the past colored backgrounds haven't looked as good as white backgrounds. But maybe I can have an animation to change that, like this website:

I don't know if I can find an animation of this on google or elsewhere, but having a rocket start from one planet and travel throughout as a background could be something to try. 

Topics: 
-Who Am I? (cool background image with name and maybe something else, but keep text limited)
-Interests: 
    -Rocketry 
    -Robotics
    -Cricket
    -Poetry (?)
    -Basketball (?)


One of my goals is to use JS rather than lots of CSS spam. However, I also want to be more efficient with CSS itself by using attributes like margins and padding, along with a potential grid system to better organize content and implement other features. 

Possible Animations:
AOS Library
Transparent Navbar that changes upon scrolling
Animations on scroll like background color change or even other animations (don't know if changing something like backgorund color on scroll is an animation?)

Maybe add background sound to the website?

Some feature like this on the top where they can scroll around (screen follows the pointer when it moves), maybe to see a bit more of the animation.

Have parallax images go from space, to mountains, to trees, and maybe city at the end, showing how its going down to Earth? Or have it the other way around.
