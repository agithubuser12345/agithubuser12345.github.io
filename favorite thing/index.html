    <h1>My Favorite Things About School</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Anish! I am currently a 9th grader at EPS. Some of the things I like to do outside of school include
        playing basketball, learning about rockets, and spending time with family. In my free time I usually do things
        like programming, reading, and basketball.</p>
    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>I am new to EPS but so far, the main classes I like are Web Design, PreCalculus, and Literature. If I have to
        choose, my favorite thing about school would be learning new things (regardless of the subject). More
        specifically, I enjoy learning about programming and using it in things like robotics. I am currently a part of
        the EPS Robotics team as a programmer. Outside of my classes, robotics is always a fun and challenging thing I
        pursue. EPS Robotics participates in FTC (First Tech Competition), which is a robotics competition league. Each
        year, a new competition theme will be released which influences how teams design their robot. In fact, the new
        FTC theme will be released on September 10th, 2022. <br><br> Below is a link for FTC. I am looking forward to
        this
        years season!

    Aside from learning new things and robotics, there are many other things I like about school.
    <ul>
        <li>Talking to teachers</li>
        <li>Reading assignments</li>
        <li>Working outside (preferably with good weather)</li>
    </ul>
