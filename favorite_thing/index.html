    <h1 style="color:orangered;">My Favorite Things About School!</h1>
    <h2 style="color:orangered;font-size: 25px;"> About Me and Overview</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Anish! I am currently a 9th grader at EPS. Some of the things I like to do outside of school include
        playing basketball, learning about rockets, programming, reading, and spending time with family. This website
        will cover my favorite things about school. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2 style="color:orangered;">My Favorite Things In School</h2>
    <ol style="color:orangered;">
        <li>Learning about new subjects and topics</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Going to a new school</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>No matter the subject, I always find learning new things to be interesting. Being
        open-minded is also a good
        skill to have as you never know what can happen when you try new things.</p>

    <h3>Robotics</h3>
    <p>I enjoy using programming in robotics as they are both one of my favorite things to do. Outside of my classes,
        robotics is always a fun and challenging thing I pursue. EPS Robotics participates in FTC (First Tech
        Competition), which is a robotics competition league. Each year, a new competition theme will be released which
        influences how teams design their robit. In fact, the new FTC theme was released on September 10th, 2022.
        <br><br>

        Below is a link for FTC. I am looking forward to this years season!

    <h3>School</h3>
    <p>I am new to EPS but so far, the main classes I like are Web Design, PreCalculus, and Literature. If I have to
        choose, my favorite thing about school would be learning new things (regardless of the subject). Going to a new
        school is always something fun as you can meet new people, teachers, and be in a different environment.

        Aside from learning new things, robotics, and being new at EPS, there are many other things I like and am
        looking
        forward to about school.
