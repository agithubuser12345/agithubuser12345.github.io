        <p>Willows Preparatory School was my old school that I attended from 6th-8th grade. Sadly, mostly all of my time
            in middle school was impacted by COVID19. In early Spring of 2020, we were moved to online school for
            about a year and a half. Luckily, once COVID19 cases came down,
            we were able to return back to school. I got to see the campus again and meet my old friends in person. Late
            into the pandemic, renovations and new buildings were being made. This finished once I started 8th grade. At
            the end of 8th grade, I bid farewell to my friends and teachers. I am currently attending a new school
            called EPS.

        <p>
            Eastside Preparatory School is a highschool that I am currently attending. This is a new school for me and
            it started a couple weeks ago. So far, I can see that EPS is a very organized school. They have very good
            teachers and clubs like robotics and much more. I can't wait to see how this year progresses.
